# Real Estate Agency Management System

## Project Overview

This project is a full-stack application developed as a preparation project for the practicum course.

The system manages real estate properties, agents, and the selling/renting process of apartments.

The architecture follows a **three-layer structure**:

Angular Client → .NET Web API → SQL Server Database

All communication with the database is performed using **Stored Procedures only**, as required by the project instructions.
